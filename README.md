# [NS-PCY5BMA] Insignia – Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter Drivers

This is a mirror of the Insignia – Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter Drivers from the Microsoft update catalog. For some reason this is not being automatically downloaded from Microsoft updates on device detection requiring a manual download of the driver despite the adatper's advertisement as "plug and play". However the driver is difficult to find because of its naming under broadcom hardware rather than its insignia branding.

To find this driver at a more trusted source, go to the Microsoft update catalog and search "Broadcom Corporation driver update for Micro size USB to Bluetooth Dongle".

Instructions: 

1. Extract the cabinet file. If you don’t see an extract button just enter the cabinet file with windows explorer by double clicking then drag/drop the files out of the window to a new folder.
2. Open your device manager, right click on “Bcm20702a0” and select update driver. Select “browse my computer for drivers” and select the folder with the extracted cabinet file.
3. The driver should download and you should see Bluetooth in your device manager.
